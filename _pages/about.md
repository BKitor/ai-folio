Hi, I am Benjamin Kitor, a computer engineering student completing his MASc at Queen's University.
I do stuff with HPC networking software, MPI, UCX and Libfabric.

My research lies at the intersection of HPC and AI, focusing on accelerating collective communication to decrease DL training time.
In terms of technology, I've spent the past few years pulling apart the internals of OpenMPI, debugging UCX atomics, and benchmarking Horovod. 
On the research front, I've designed and implemented multiple collective algorithms leveraging techniques like topology awareness and process arrival pattern awareness.

Outside of work/school, I tend to jump between hobbies.
Recent interests have included reading non-fiction (topics include finance, economics, and geopolitics), lifting weights, and playing hockey.
